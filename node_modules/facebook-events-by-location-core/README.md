# Search Facebook events by location, distance and search terms

As Facebook has discontinued the FQL query API for all apps created after 2014-04-30, it has gotten much more complicated to get public Facebook events by passing a location.

This implementation uses regular Facebook Graph API calls in a three-step approach to get the events:

1. Search for places in the radius of the passed coordinate and distance (`/search?type=place&q={query}&center={coordinate}&distance={distance}`)
2. Use the places to query for their events in parallel (`/?ids={id1},{id2},{id3},...`)
3. Unify, filter and sort the results from the parallel calls and return them to the client

### Known limitations

* The Graph API has some "instabilities" with search results. It's possible that the amount of results returned can vary between calls within seconds
* The `/search` endpoint "magically" limits the number of results, independent from the `distance` used (larger distance doesn't guarantee more results)
* [Rate limiting](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/advanced/rate-limiting) will apply, but I experienced no call blocks within a reasonable amount of service requests. Be aware that the way this application works, there are potentially hundreds of (counted) Graph API calls per request to `/events`.

## Installation

### As NPM package

The module can be installed via 

`npm install facebook-events-by-location-core --save`

### Git

To clone the repository, use

`git clone https://github.com/tobilg/facebook-events-by-location-core.git`

## Usage

The basic usage pattern of this module is the following:

```javascript
var EventSearch = require("facebook-events-by-location-core");

var es = new EventSearch({
    "lat": 40.710803,
    "lng": -73.964040
});

es.search().then(function (events) {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(events));
}).catch(function (error) {
    console.error(JSON.stringify(error));
});
```

### Access Tokens

The above example expects that the `FEBL_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable is set to a valid App Access Token. Otherwise, you need to specify the `accessToken` parameter with the request.

### Parameters

Mandatory parameters are the following:

* `lat`: The latitude of the position/coordinate the events shall be returned for
* `lng`: The longitude of the position/coordinate the events shall be returned for

Non-mandatory parameters

* `query`: The term(s) on which you want to narrow down your *location search* (this only filters the places, not the events itself!).
* `accessToken`: The **App Access Token** to be used for the requests to the Graph API.
* `distance`: The distance in meters (it makes sense to use smaller distances, like max. 2500). Default is `100`.
* `sort`: The results can be sorted by `time`, `distance`, `venue` or `popularity`. If omitted, the events will be returned in the order they were received from the Graph API.
* `version`: The version of the Graph API to use. Default is `v2.7`.
* `since`: The start of the range to filter results. Format is Unix timestamp or `strtotime` data value, as accepted by [FB Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/using-graph-api#time).
* `until`: The end of the range to filter results.
